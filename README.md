Scripts for hardening Ubuntu or Debian droplets on Digital Ocean. Read and understand before running.
Here is a list of scripts and a brief description of what they do.
1. harden-kernel.sh updates the kernel to the latest mainline generic build for AMD64 from kernel.org
2. harden-openssl.sh updates OpenSSL to the latest version from OpenSSL.org
3. harden-openssh.sh updates OpenSSH to the latest version from OpenSSH.org
4. harden-lynis.sh installs lynis from github CISOfy/lynis and runs for the first time.
5. harden-ppa adds my favourite repositaries for apache2, php, nginx and MariaDB
